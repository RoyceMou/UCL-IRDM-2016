# UCL-IRDM-2016

The code used to run the MLR model is in MLR.ipynb.
The code used to run the ARIMA model is in arima.R.
The code used to run the LSTM model is in lstm.py.
The scripts are fairly straightforward to run on each respoective platform. In lstm.py however, the zone needs to be set since the runtime is fairly long compared to the other models. 


The load history with the trend used to calculate the MLR model is in the file formatted_load_history_with_trend.csv.
The temperature history with interpolated missing values if in the file formatted_temperature_history_missingValue_to_average.csv.
